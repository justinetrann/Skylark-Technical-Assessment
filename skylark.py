# Function: process_stock_data
# This function processes stock trading data and returns a tuple of length 8, containing:
# 
# 1. The company with the highest total share volume traded.
#    - Which comapany had the most shares traded in total.
# 2. The average share volume traded.
#    - On average, how many shares were traded per trade

#    - What was the last tradeded price for each company
#
# Constraints:
# - Function Written in Python
# - No third-party libraries like pandas or numpy are used.

# Timestamp: When the trade happened.
# Ticker: The company (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
# Price: The price per share.
# Volume: How many shares were traded.
